      "and of course, this is significant because laci peterson, when she disappeared from her modesto home, was 7 1/2 months pregnant. \n",
      "that was on christmas eve. \n",
      "her husband, scott, at the time said that he was fishing in the berkeley marina. \n",
      "now, in a strange twist in all of this, just yesterday separate from the skeletal remains i alluded to earlier a man hiking near the berkeley marina found a bone, and they are now looking at that as another possible lead in this case. \n",
      "this person came across the bone at the shore. \n",
      "he brought it home and contacted the authorities, and we took possession of it. \n",
      "and you're trying to connect it to the other -- well, we're trying to find out if it's a human bone and whether or not it is related to the others. \n",
      "reporter: and yet another reason why that bone could be a key link, there are reports that have surfaced that in terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton was not completely intact. \n",
      "now this case is also taking on a rather, we should say, almost a tv episodic forensic pathology angle because they're going to bring in an expert on what's called alufating decay, and basically this person is going to come in here and look at the body. \n",
      "this is in the damage aspect of it. \n",
      "and they say these experts will be able to tell how long the body had been in there and if the remains of the almost full-term baby boy were inside the female's remains at the time of death. \n",
      "also, the coroner could know right now but is not saying if there was some sort of trauma to either of these skeletons, for example, if they could see the bone compromised in some way they could tell if there had been a stab or a shooting. \n",
      "we may learn a lot more on this in just 15 minutes. \n",

      "reporter: it sounds like all of this will be too quick, and it seems underlying all this is there could be an absence of dental records. \n",
      "that's particularly important for the adult female remains. \n",
      "so now they're going to have to turn to dna, and that's why they're calling in these experts. \n",

      "Secretary of State Colin Powell said the offer was made during three-way talks between US, North Korean and Chinese diplomats last week in Beijing. \n",
      "At the same meeting Pyongyang confirmed it had nuclear weapons, and threatened to prove it with a \"display.\" \n",
      "\"The North Koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were doing and, in effect, said that these are now up for further discussion,\" he told reporters at the State Department. \n",
      "\"They did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their nuclear capability and their missile activities, but they, of course, expect something considerable in return,\" Powell said. \n",
      "\"We are studying that plan, we are examining it with our friends and allies,\" Powell said, adding that talks were now underway with the South Korean, Japanese, Russian and Australian as well as other governments. \n",
      "\"It was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go from here,\" he said, referring to the April 23 to 25 discussions in Beijing. \n",
      "Powell gave no indication as to whether Washington would accept the offer, and did not address what Pyongyang was demanding in terms of concesssions. \n",
      "However other US officials said the North Koreans had presented a lengthy list of demands. \n",
      "The demands include full normalization of ties with the United States, security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil and other energy considerations. \n",
      "\"They had quite a list of things,\" State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters. \n",
      "Asked specifically about normalization of relations and economic assistance, Boucher replied: \"I don't really quibble with that characterization of the list.\" \n",
      "A senior State Department official said later that the list of demands was so extensive that it defied a \"concise description.\" \n",
      "\"It basically listed everything they have ever asked for,\" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity, identifying oil and energy supplies as demands. \n",

      "\"We've made clear we're not going to pay for elimination of the nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first place,\" he said. \n",
      "Powell acknowledged that North Korea had hinted it could prove it possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the Beijing talks, but maintained that the North Koreans had not used the words \"test\" or \"testing.\" \n",
      "\"They said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in one way or another,\" he said. \n",
      "The concessions demanded by Pyongyang were part of a \"bold\" proposal for addressing the nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula that North Korea presented in Beijing, officials said. \n",
      "South Korean newspapers reported earlier Monday that the North suggested that Pyongyang and Washington act simultaneously and equally to resolve the six-month-old nuclear crisis. \n",
      "Boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides, stressing that Washington would not consider such moves until the \"verifiable and irreversible termination\" of the north's nuclear programs. \n",

      "The North's ruling Workers Party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, indicated Sunday that North Korea wanted economic and political \"rewards\" from the United States in return for the elimination of its nuclear program. \n",
      "Rodong called for a \"fair and equal\" footing in talks with the United States, blasting Washington for insisting that there would be \"no security of the system nor provision of rewards\" even if Pyongyang gave up its nuclear program. \n",

      "Hu, who was appointed to the top job in March, will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during his three-day state visit from May 26 to 28. \n",
      "He will then stay on for a regional summit before heading to Saint Petersburg for celebrations marking the 300th anniversary of the city's founding. \n",
      "\"This upcoming visit to Russia will be my first trip aboard since I became president of China. \n",
      "I plan a thorough exchange of views with President Vladimir Putin on bilateral and important regional and international issues,\" Hu said in an interview with Russia's Interfax news agency. \n",
      "\"Our discussions should strengthen political trust between the two sides and mutually beneficial cooperation to raise Russian-Chinese relations to a new level,\" he added. \n",

      "\"Presidents Vladimir Putin and Hu Jintao have developed good personal contacts, which will undoubtedly facilitate the promotion of the Russian strategic partnership,\" Russia's ambassador to China Igor Rogachyov said, quoted by Interfax. \n",
      "Russia has given a high priority to its relations with the United States despite a bitter disagreement over the US-led campaign to topple Saddam Hussein in Iraq. \n",

      "Although the Russian government is formally committed to building an extension of the pipeline that would supply Japan through the Russian port of Nakhodka, experts believe that project is unlikely to see the light of day. \n",
      "Russian oil giant Yukos, whose output will be shipped through the pipeline, had lobbied furiously for the Chinese route although the state pipeline monopoly Transneft argued that it was wrong to tie strategic Russian energy resources to the whims of a single buyer. \n",
      "\"Single customers are always a danger. \n",
      "However, the project makes economic sense,\" commented Asia expert Dmitry Trenin, deputy director in Moscow of the Carnegie Center, a Washington-based think tank. \n",
      "The shorter Chinese route, a 2,400-kilometre project, would cost around half the Japanese pipeline, at 2.5 billion dollars (2.15 billion euros), and would need to transport just 20 million tonnes a year to be economic. \n",
      "China, whose booming economy has turned the country into an increasingly valuable economic partner for Russia, especially in its backward far eastern regions, is also a major purchaser of Russian weapons. \n",
      "\"It's a very important relationship. \n",
      "China is a very dynamic neighbour and a rising world power. \n",
      "In many ways it is far ahead of Russia,\" Trenin said. \n",
      "The Chinese president expressed the hope that bilateral trade could be raised from its current level of 12 billion dollars a year to 20 billion dollars. \n",
      "Analysts however cautioned against any attempt to turn the focus from economic cooperation to a broader strategic alliance, given that both sides opposed the war in Iraq. \n",
      "\"The Chinese are trying to establish a rapport (between Hu and Putin) and this is in Russia's interests. \n",
      "However, this rapport should not serve the role of forming an alliance to counter American dominance in the world,\" said Trenin. \n",

      "Several hours later, dozens of Israeli tanks advanced into the northern Gaza Strip backed by helicopters which fired at least three rockets in the Jabaliya area, Palestinian security sources said. \n",
      "Palestinian medical sources said 60-year-old Mohammed al-Biyari was killed in his home near Jabaliya refugee camp by the rocket fire and another wounded. \n",
      "A second rocket landed in farmlands and the other hit a house inside the refugee camp, but without causing further casualties, Palestinian security sources said. \n",
      "Two 13-year-old children were among those killed in the Haifa bus bombing, Israeli public radio said, adding that most of the victims were youngsters. \n",
      "The army said two soldiers were also among the dead. \n",
      "The bus was ripped to shreds while travelling between a residential area and Haifa university. \n",
      "Of the 33 injured still in hospital late Wednesday, two were in intensive care and six others in serious condition, the radio said. \n",
      "Israel's night-time raid in Gaza involving around 40 tanks and armoured vehicles came after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened his security cabinet to discuss a response to the bomb attack. \n",
      "Israeli media said the retaliation was unlikely to be on a scale that would risk disrupting US preparations for war on Iraq. \n",
      "The Palestinian suicide bomber on the Haifa bus came from the southern West Bank town of Hebron, public radio said, naming him as 20-year-old Mahmoud Hamadan Salim Qawasmi. \n",
      "Apart from his ID card, also found in the wreckage were the remains of a letter allegedly outlining his plan to carry out a suicide attack and praising the September 2001 destruction of the World Trade Centre in New York, it said. \n",
      "Israeli police were not immediately available for comment, but Palestinian sources in Hebron said Mahmoud Qawasmi was a 21-year-old student with links to the Islamic radical group Hamas. \n",
      "Israeli forces moved into Hebron's Al-Sheikh district where his family lived and arrested Qawasmi's brother and father after the bombing, they said. \n",
      "Without claiming responsibility, Hamas and another hardline group, Islamic Jihad, said the blast was revenge for a string of bloody Israeli army raids into the Gaza Strip in recent weeks. \n",
      "But the Palestinian Authority condemned the attack, saying it would divert international sympathy away from the far higher Palestinian civilian death toll. \n",
      "\"We condemn all attacks against civilians including today's attack in Haifa,\" said information minister Yasser Abed Rabbo. \n",
      "The Palestinian leadership said the attack would serve as \"a pretext for Israel's government and occupation army to step up its deadly campaign which caused the deaths of 77 Palestinians in February\". \n",
      "It was the first bomb attack inside Israel since January 5, and came just days after the hawkish Sharon appointed the most right-wing government in Israel's history on a pledge to get tough on security. \n",
      "In the January attack, two Palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up in central Tel Aviv, killing 23 other people. \n",
      "Israeli government spokesman Avi Pazner called the latest deadly blast a \"very grave attack\" and said the Jewish state would take \"vigorous action against the terrorist organisations\". \n",
      "He told AFP that Israeli intelligence had been dealing with at least 40 tip-offs of impending attacks when the Haifa bus was blown up. \n",
      "US President George W. Bush condemned the \"attack on innocents in Israel,\" White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, adding that \"his message to the terrorists is: Their efforts will not be succcessful. \n",
      "\"He will continue to pursue the path to peace in the Middle East.\" \n",
      "EU foreign policy supremo Javier Solana likewise slammed the attack, although he also took a jab at Israel, saying, \"There have been too many civilians killed in the last weeks and the last days.\" \n",
      "In London, a spokesman for the British prime minister said Tony Blair \"condemns absolutely what has happened\". \n",
      "The spokesman added that he \"would obviously call on all sides to do what they can to break the cycle of violence, because it is only through engagement that we can realise the vision everyone wants to see. \n",
      "\"There needs to be dialogue in order for this to be resolved.\" \n",
      "The bus attack came just two days after Israeli forces staged a bloody raid into a refugee camp in central Gaza targeting a founding member of Hamas, which has spearheaded suicide bombings against the Jewish state. \n",
      "Hamas vowed to continue its attacks, while the Palestinian Authority accused Israel of trying to disrupt top-level Palestinian meetings to discuss reforms of Arafat's administration. \n",
      "Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said international intervention was needed to break the cycle of violence. \n",
      "Eight people, including a pregnant woman and a 13-year-old child were killed in Monday's Gaza raid, provoking US-led international calls for Israeli restraint. \n",

      "\"Palestinian police have taken over all the posts and positions they held before September 28, 2000. \n",
      "It is the first time they have had freedom of movement with cars and weapons since the start of the intifada,\" the source said. \n",
      "The move marked a huge step forward in carrying out the US-backed Middle East \"roadmap\", which aims to end the months of bloodshed and create a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians. \n",
      "Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town of Beit Hanoun late Sunday, police took up positions there and in the neighbouring town of Beit Lahiya, he said. \n",
      "They also deployed along the border with Israel. \n",
      "The handover is a credibility test for the Palestinian Authority, which must show it means business when it comes to reining in hardline groups plotting attacks on the Jewish state. \n",
      "In another first in the almost three-year intifada, the Israeli army allowed Palestinians free circulation on the trans-Gaza highway as troops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal territory. \n",
      "Traffic was flowing freely through the Netzarim junction, just south of Gaza City, the Kissufim junction by Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, and the Guest House junction just south of Deir al-Balah after the army withdrew. \n",
      "The three military checkpoints on the highway, which runs the entire length of the Gaza Strip, had transformed the trip from north to south, ordinarily a 30-minute ride, into a grinding two or three-hour ordeal and came to symbolise the horrors of occupation. \n",
      "\"Israel has implemented most of the agreement except for a few issues,\" the source said, pointing out that Israel had still not removed two military observation posts at the Kissufim junction and the Guest House junction. \n",
      "Although there was free movement along the trans-Gaza highway, several other roads remained temporarily closed, he said. \n",
      "The Karni-Netzarim road, which runs east-to-west across the route, was still closed as was the section of the highway passing close by Kfar Darom settlement, just south of the Guest House junction, he said, adding both were likely to be opened in the coming weeks. \n",
      "Another road, leading from the southern border town of Rafah to Khan Yunis, would be opened within 10 days, he said. \n",
      "Adressing Palestinian complaints, an Israeli military source confirmed troops had installed a gate at the Netzarim crossing and at the southern Guest House junction but said that they were only there for when Jewish settlers needed to use the road. \n",
      "A ban on Palestinian men under the age of 35 being allowed to move freely was still in force but that was expected to be lifted later on Monday or early Tuesday. \n",
      "The army also handed over control of Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt to the Palestinians, security sources said. \n",
      "Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the Palestinian section of the border crossing, which had been taken over by Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising. \n",
      "Under the 1993 Oslo accords, which granted a measure of autonomy to the Palestinians, the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was to be jointly managed by both Israel and the Palestinians, although Israel had final control over the zone. \n",
      "Although the crossing has, in principle, been open for movement between the two territories -- while being frequently closed by Israeli for reasons rarely explained -- the Palestinian section has been manned by Israel for more than two years.\n",

      "Interesting terminology... I believe they're referring to the budget deficit and... the capital surplus? \n",
      "When analyzing trade deficits, it's important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the US. \n",
      "So the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from US consumers (who control about 20% of global GDP) and everybody else (excluding the non-consumption share of US GDP, that would amount to around 75% of global GDP). \n",
      "Which of those is -- probably -- going to be a more important number? \n",
      "Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods, the largest pressure on the deficit is that we're simply a better place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face. \n",
      "And what about that other deficit? \n",
      "It, of course, is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes, but by borrowing funds. \n",
      "And about half of those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia. \n",
      "So, not to be a heretic, but 1) We're issuing them at relatively low interest rates, 2) Inflation is bound to pick up eventually, and so 3) Wouldn't you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non-US investors, rather than raising taxes in America? \n",
      "It's a question of who will pay for the same spending, and all else being equal I'd be happy for Asian central banks to pick up the tab. \n",

      "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who favors the deployment, hinted that he will reshuffle the Cabinet, but gave no indication if he would purge officials who opposed letting in the troops as analysts have suggested he might do. \n",
      "Erdogan is extremely popular in Turkey and is likely be one of the few leaders with enough clout to unite his party and gain public support for allowing in the U.S. troops. \n",
      "Turks overwhelmingly oppose a war _ by 94 percent, according to some polls. \n",
      "Earlier this month, the Turkish parliament shocked the United States by rejecting the deployment by just four votes. \n",
      "Erdogan has hinted that he will resubmit the resolution for approval, which could take another week. \n",
      "The United States is pressing Turkey to act quickly. \n",
      "Ships carrying equipment for U.S. troops are already waiting off the Turkish coast In Washington, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen.

      "The troop-basing resolution would allow the United States to use Turkish airspace. \n",
      "If the resolution is not passed, Washington would likely want to use the airspace for strikes against Iraq and for airlifting troops to northern Iraq. \n",
      "Refusing access to the troop deployment would mean Turkey would lose a US$15 billion U.S. aid package that Washington has offered to help cushion the country's economy if there is war. \n",
      "It would also threaten Turkey's possible role in the future of Iraq. \n",
      "Turkey, which fears northern Iraqi Kurds may declare independence in the aftermath of a war, has been pressing for a say if Saddam Hussein is ousted. \n",
      "Secession by Iraqi Kurds could inspire Turkey's rebel Kurds, who for 15 years have been fighting for autonomy. \n",
      "After he was elected, Erdogan said Turkey wanted assurances from the United States on its role in Iraq. \n",
      "Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday there had been talks that Turkish troops could be deployed ``a short distance from their border to try to avoid refugee infiltration.'' \n",
      "Iraqi Kurds fear that Turkish troops could move deep into the autonomous enclave in northern Iraq and have threatened clashes. \n",
      "Rumsfeld also said that like Turkey, the United States doesn't want to see a breakaway state: ``Our interest, needless to say, is to see that Iraq remains a single country,'' he said at the Pentagon news conference. \n",
      "Prime Minister Abdullah Gul resigned earlier Tuesday to make way for Erdogan, who won a parliamentary seat in by-elections Sunday. \n",
      "Gul will remain as a caretaker prime minister until President Ahmet Necdet Sezer approves Erdogan's Cabinet, a move that could happen as early as Wednesday. \n",
      "Erdogan said he would submit his Cabinet list to the president ``as soon as possible,'' and leaders of Erdogan's Justice and Development Party met Tuesday evening. \n",
      "When asked about possible changes in the Cabinet, Erdogan said: ``Perhaps there will be a small amount of change, a certain number of revisions.'' \n",
      "Gul's resignation had been long expected. \n",
      "Erdogan heads the party but was constitutionally barred from running in November elections because he was jailed in 1999 for anti-secular activities. \n",
      "The Justice party changed the constitution after taking power in the elections. \n",
      "Erdogan, a leader of Turkey's pro-Islamic movement when he was jailed, said he moderated his policies in prison. \n",
      "His party considers itself conservative and no longer uses the word 'Islamic' in its literature. \n",
      "He now also advocates letting in U.S. troops for a war against Iraq even though it is a fellow Muslim state. \n",
      "Unlike the soft-spoken Gul, Erdogan has a reputation as a fighter. \n",

      "Like we haven't heard this rant before. \n",
      "Yes, only the Christians value life when it's a life before birth. \n",
      "Of course it would be wrong to make people feel \"horribly guilty\" over abortion, but celebrating the skull-cracking procedure \"for the sake of the child\" in the form of t-shirts and jewelry is to be admired. \n",
      "The problem for the pro-abortion movement is that hardly anyone is taking a stand to reverse this societal brainwashing. \n",
      "Even by calling the movement \"pro-choice\" instead of \"pro-abortion,\" it gives credence to the Christian loonies. \n",
      "Here is where I agree with my fellow Libertarian. \n",

      "It was not immediately clear if Pyongyang would drop its demand for a nonaggression pact. \n",

      "It said it will ignore any U.N. resolution on the nuclear issue. \n",
      "If the U.N. Security Council cooperates with U.S. efforts to ``stifle'' North Korea, it would leave the North with ``no other option but to beef up the deterrent force for war by mobilizing all the potentials,'' KCNA quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. \n",

      "The accident occurred ``recently'' in Chinese waters east of the Neichangshan islands, the brief Chinese-language report said. \n",
      "The islands are in the Yellow Sea, between the northeastern province of Liaoning and North Korea. \n",
      "The submarine was on an exercise when the accident occurred, and ``because of a mechanical malfunction, the 70 crew members on board died,'' the Xinhua report said. \n",
      "It did not give further details or say how the crew died. \n",
      "The vessel already has been towed back to an unidentified port, Xinhua said. \n",
      "It said the hull number was 361, which military analysts said appeared to make it a Ming-class submarine, a vessel used for patrols and coastal defense. \n",
      "The announcement was unusual for a communist government that rarely acknowledges military accidents. \n",
      "It was the first time China has announced a fatal submarine mishap, said Bernard Cole, a professor at the U.N. National War College in Washington and a specialist on the Chinese navy. \n",
      "``There have been rumors going around about the loss of submarines, but this is the first fatal accident that I know of,'' said Cole. \n",
      "China's military, which has a tradition of secrecy, did not comment about the accident Friday night. \n",
      "Foreign military analysts said it would be highly unusual for an accident to kill a whole submarine crew while still allowing the vessel to be recovered. \n",
      "They suggested possible causes ranging from a sinking in shallow water to a disaster that flooded the vessel with toxic chemical fumes. \n",
      "Michael McGinty, an expert on the Chinese navy from the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies in London, said that the mishap likely happened while the submarine was on the surface. \n",
      "If the accident happened when the vessel was underwater, it was less likely that China could have recovered it, said McGinty, a former British submariner. \n",
      "``For an accident to have been so catastrophic when the submarine was on the surface, I find it a very mysterious thing,'' he said. \n",
      "McGinty said that the submarine's batteries might have leaked acid that mixed with seawater, creating toxic chlorine gas that killed the crew. \n",

      "China began building the Ming-class subs in the 1970s, and they are obsolete by modern standards, according to the Federation of American Scientists. \n",
      "The first three Ming-class subs were completed between 1971 and 1979, and one of them was scrapped after a fire, according to the Web site of Jane's Information Group, a leading of source defense information. \n",
      "China is believed to have as many as 19 Ming-class submarines. \n",
      "China's submarine fleet includes 66 boats, most of them aging diesel-electric vessels, McGinty said. \n",
      "He said the fleet suffers from a chronic lack of money, training and maintenance. \n",
      "But the Chinese are aggressively updating their fleet with Russian-made Kilo-class diesel-electric subs. \n",
      "``The submarine force is the most potent part of the Chinese navy,'' said Cole. \n",
      "Despite the difficulty of maintaining a fleet, subs are valuable because they are hard to detect, Cole said. \n",

      "Their collapse left the U.S. troops less than 20 miles from Saddam Hussein's capital. \n",
      "Bet`fow Central Command chief Gen. Tommy Franks and his field commanders face a big decision _ whether to rush into the city of 5 million where Hussein's regime has gathered its most-trusted forces or wait and see if the war can be won without paying the price of street-to-street urban fighting. \n",
      "``We are expectingn or at least planning for, a very difficult fight ahead,'' Gen. Stanley McChrystal said at the Pentagon Tuesday. \n",
      "``We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it.'' \n",
      "Instead of an all-out assault, analysts expect the United States to follow the example of British forces outside the southern Iraqi city of Basra. \n",
      "They are likely to mount small probing patrols into the city to determine the level of Iraqi resistance. \n",
      "If these patrols meet little opposition, thousands of troops could rush into the city. \n",
      "If the Iraqis respond forcefully, the Army and Marine units could withdraw and await the 4th Mechanized Infantry Division, which will soon start moving north from Kuwait. \n",
      "While they wait, the forces would try to determine where Iraqi strong points are within the city and where Hussein might be, if he is still alive. \n",
      "``The Basra model will work for a while, at least until you see problems with food and water for civilians in the city,'' said Lawrence Korb, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who was assistant defense secretary under former President Ronald Reagan. \n",
      "``Before going in (with a full assault), you have to decide if it's worth the risks, and ... you have to know who's there in the way of Iraqi forces and the amount of potential damage to civilians,'' he said. \n",
      "The administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to Iraqi civilians, which makes the British experience around Basra instructive, the analysts said. \n",
      "The British have been outside the city of 1.5 million for more than a week. \n",
      "Thousands of refugees have fled the city, apparently providing information to the British that has led to raids on military and Baath Party sites in the city. \n",
      "``The key endgame may be whether the U.S. can parse out the key regime centers of power in Baghdad and attack them without having to fight into the city, or at least locate them well enough to atman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his daily war report. \n",
      "U.S. strategists say that Hussein, if he is still alive and in control of his forces, might like a bloody battle in Baghdad because such fighting could cause heavy U.S. casualties. \n",
      "His last hope for survival might be that the United States loses its taste for such losses and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would allow Hussein and his family to keep power in Baghdad. \n",
      "But Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington said the apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could deprive Hussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the city. \n",
      "``If U.S. forces seriously degrade Iraq's half-dozen Republican Guard divisions before that final battle, and only have to face perhaps 30,000 Special Republican Guard, fedayeen, and related personnel, the task will not be as hard as it might have been,'' he said. \n",
      "While two guard divisions have apparently been smashed, there are three others in the Baghdad area. \n",
      "A sixth remains in northern Iraq. \n",
      "Cordesman said it seems the guards have been reinforced by units from the regular Iraqi army, which is generally viewed as less reliable. \n",
      "This shows the Iraqi military's growing weakness, he said. \n",
      "``The Republican Guard has taken a massive hammering at every level and is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at the brigade level,'' he said. \n",
      "The Iraqis still haven't used chemical weapons, even though many experts feared such attacks as the U.S. troops neared Baghdad. \n",
      "Korb, who's convinced Hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never reported to U.N. inspectors, said he wouldn't be surprised if Hussein tried to use them. \n",
      "But he also said, ``He may destroy them to embarrass us,'' to show the world he never had such weapons and that Bush invaded for no reason other than aggression. \n",
      "The U.S. forces zeroing in on Baghdad _ the 1st Marine Division from the east and the Army's 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division _ are trained in urban warfare. \n",
      "But in such close-quarters fighting, they would lose much of the technological advantage of their air supremacy, which would have to be curtailed because bombing in a city can cause large civilian casualties. \n",

      "Iraq resumed destroying banned Al Samoud 2 missiles under U.N. supervision Saturday after taking a day off, crushing six more in a process that chief inspector Hans Blix called a ``substantial measure of disarmament.'' \n",
      "In the past week, Iraq has destroyed 40 of its 100 Al Samoud 2 missiles, prohibited by the United Nations because some tests indicated they could fly farther than 150 kilometers (93 miles). \n",
      "It also has been destroying equipment used to make them. \n",
      "Reports to the Security Council on Friday by Blix and chief nuclear inspector Mohammed ElBaradei praised Iraq's recent compliance. \n",
      "But inspectors also questioned Iraq's motivation, as it began to give the inspectors what they wanted only when the threat of war became immediate. \n",
      "U.S. President George W. Bush said the reports indicated that only a war will make Iraq disarm. \n",
      "``Unfortunately, it is clear that Saddam Hussein is still violating the demands of the United Nations by refusing to disarm,'' he told Americans in a radio address Saturday. \n",
      "Iraq, however, took the report as an endorsement of its work and argued not only that war plans should be canceled, but that sanctions imposed on it by the Security Council for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be removed. \n",
      "``We demand that the Security Council and the world decide on ... the lifting of sanctions on Iraq in a comprehensive and complete way,'' said a spokesman for a meeting Saturday of Saddam and top-level officials, quoted by official Iraqi news media. \n",
      "The unidentified spokesman claimed the weapons inspectors had verified Iraq has rid itself of weapons of mass destruction _ something the inspectors said would take months to do _ and appealed for a ban on such weapons to be extended beyond Iraq: to Israel, and eventually to the United States. \n",
      "The spokesman, reporting on the meeting, said Iraq called on the Security Council ``to rid the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction since Iraq has become free of them.'' \n",
      "``At the front of those that must be rid of these weapons is the Zionist entity,'' he said in a reference to Israel, adding that the order should ``move on after this region to America.'' \n",
      "The newspaper Babil, a popular daily owned by Saddam's son Odai, also said Saturday that the reports of Blix and ElBaradei were enough to suspend the sanctions, which are to be removed when the United Nations verifies that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction or the means to make them. \n",
      "In a front-page editorial, Babil said the reports should push Security Council members ``to think seriously about issuing a resolution lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq, since it was proven that we don't possess weapons of mass destruction.'' \n",
      "Saddam has long claimed Iraq destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction. \n",
      "The United States and Britain claim he's lying, and have assembled a quarter-million troops around Iraq for a possible invasion. \n",
      "Despite Iraq's demands of the Security Council, diplomats were working hard on very different proposals: a U.S.-led plan for disarmament or war by March 17, and a rival French plan for an emergency summit of Security Council members to come up with a compromise. \n",
      "Bush and top advisers planned to lobby allies by telephone through the weekend and up until next week's planned vote on the ultimatum. \n",
      "French President Jacques Chirac talked to heads of state in an effort to drum up support for his plan, his office said. \n",
      "Inspectors' spokesman Hiro Ueki said Iraqi workers crushed six Al Samoud 2 missiles Saturday at the al-Taji military complex north of Baghdad, under the supervision of weapons inspectors. \n",
      "Three of the missiles had warheads and three didn't, apparently because they hadn't been deployed. \n",
      "Inspectors also supervised the destruction of tools and ``special equipment used to produce the Al Samoud 2 engine'' at the Al Samoud factory, he said, and another group of inspectors verified the emptying of Al Samoud 2 warheads at the Qa Qa complex just south of Baghdad. \n",
      "Odai al-Taie, a senior Information Ministry official, said the workers crushing the missiles took Friday off because they had worked on Tuesday, the Muslim new year. \n",
      "Ueki described Friday as a ``planning day'' for teams working on missile destruction. \n",
      "Ueki said an Iraqi chemical scientist granted an interview to weapons inspectors, bringing to eight the number of scientists who have given interviews since Feb. 28, when Iraq began urging them to talk. \n",
      "Since the same date, four scientists have refused. \n",
      "Interviews with nuclear scientists have been conducted more frequently because the nuclear inspectors don't mind the scientists tape recording the interviews, a sticking point for the chemical and biological teams. \n",
      "Inspectors also returned to a former helicopter airfield where Iraq buried bombs it says were armed with biological weapons in 1991. \n",
      "Ueki said inspectors there took samples from the remainders of stainless steel containers Iraq says it used to transport biological agents.\n",

      "\"If we execute them now we can't bring them to life again should their appeals for a review be granted,\" said Antasari Azhar, spokesman for the attorney general's office. \n",

      "A convict can file a case review or appeal for presidential clemency only after the Supreme Court upholds a sentence imposed by a lower court. \n",

      "Maybe he tried to invest in his paper, maybe he believed sincerely in his admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and his ability of earning PhDs, but using a big car and living in a big house are signs for the masses that the man is an invaluable and irreplaceable leader. \n",

      "U.S. troops thwarted a Baghdad bank robbery over the protests of Iraqis eager to share in the loot. \n",
      "As U.S. forces struggled to restore order in Iraq, FBI Director Robert Mueller announced that agents had been detailed to help recover antiquities looted from museums in Baghdad and elsewhere. \n",
      "Agents will aid international efforts to recover stolen items ``on both the open and black markets,'' he said. \n",
      "With the fighting all but over, the USS Constellation steamed from the Persian Gulf for its home port, carrying dozens of warplanes no longer needed. \n",

      "``I think what will happen is we'll discover people who will tell us where to go find it.'' \n",
      "U.S. troops have found suspicious chemicals and facilities at a number of sites but tests on the materials have proved negative or inconclusive. \n",
      "Eliminating such weapons was a chief reason President George W. Bush gave for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that began March 20. \n",
      "Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks announced the capture of Barzan Ibrahim Hasan al-Tikriti, telling reporters he was an adviser to Saddam ``with extensive knowledge of the regime's inner workings.'' \n",
      "A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Barzan Ibrahim had been a presidential adviser to Saddam's regime since 1998, but had a shaky relationship with his half brother and was not part of the regime's inner circle. \n",
      "He was a representative to the United Nations in Geneva from 1989 to 1998. \n",
      "Earlier, from 1979 to 1983, he headed Iraq's Mukhabarat, or intelligence service, a period when the organization arranged executions of regime opponents in Iraq and overseas, the official said. \n",
      "Brooks provided scant details of the operation that netted Barzan Ibrahim, saying he was taken inside Baghdad and that U.S. special forces were aided by Marines. \n",
      "He said there were no casualties. \n",
      "Another of Saddam's three half brothers, Watban Ibrahim Hasan al-Tikriti, was captured earlier by U.S. forces. \n",
      "The third has not been found. \n",
      "American forces have been criticized for failing to stop looting in several Baghdad cities, and there have been complaints, as well, that humanitarian relief has been slow in arriving. \n",
      "But Marines foiled a brazen act of lawlessness during the day when they interrupted a robbery-in-progress at a branch of the al-Rashid Bank and took away US$4 million for safekeeping. \n",
      "Thieves had blown a hole in the vault and dropped children in to bring out fistfuls of cash. \n",
      "As word spread that the robbery was under way, Iraqis gathered, saying they had accounts at the branch, and a riot broke out. \n",
      "Marines broke it up _ over the protests of Iraqis not involved in the robbery _ and the thieves were arrested. \n",
      "``These people want the money and they believe it is rightfully their money, but they don't understand that the proper distribution is not first-come, first-served,'' said Col. Philip DeCamp, a battalion commander. \n",
      "Gen. Tommy Franks, the commander of Operation Iraqi Freedom, told reporters during a visit to Kuwait that ``the looting goes down every day and I think you will continue to see it go down because the Iraqis are now stepping up and controlling the problems for themselves.'' \n",
      "There was evidence of slow progress. \n",
      "Baghdad residents gathered outside the city's police academy when word spread that some of the cars looted in recent days had been recovered. \n",

      "Unrest continued in other parts of the country. \n",
      "Americans sought to bring calm to Mosul, where U.S. troops killed 17 people in clashes earlier in the week. \n",
      "Brooks, briefing reporters at the U.S. Central Command headquarters, also disclosed that Marines had broken up violent clashes on Wednesday in Tikrit, Saddam's hometown. \n",
      "The fighting broke out between club-wielding members of the former ruler's clan and a rival group, he said. \n",
      "Clan rivalries aside, there are numerous other resentments shaping events in the post-Saddam era. \n",
      "Majority Shiite Muslims are eager for power after decades of Saddam favoring Sunni Muslims, for example. \n",
      "And Kurds are eager to claim what they say Saddam took from them and gave to Arabs in the northern part of the country. \n",
      "International experts, appalled at the looting of Iraqi historical artifacts, met in Paris under U.N. auspices and called for a temporary embargo on Iraqi cultural objects. \n",
      "Some of the participants at the meeting said it appeared the looting was organized, and some of those involved had keys to museum vaults and were able to remove items from safes. \n",
      "One suggested the effort was organized from outside Iraq. \n",
      "``It looks as if part of the looting was a deliberate planned action,'' said McGuire Gibson, a University of Chicago professor and president of the American Association for Research in Baghdad. \n",
      "``I have a suspicion it was organized outside the country, in fact I'm pretty sure it was,'' Gibson said. \n",

      "Mr. Chairman, let me begin with you. \n",
      "Are you among those who are beginning to conclude that, when all the dust settles, the U.S. may not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? \n",
      "SEN. RICHARD LUGAR (R), INDIANA No, I concur with Secretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld, the president, that weapons of mass destruction are there, and likewise, that we will be led to them by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they are. \n",
      "What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and, likewise, the intellectual capital that is there to produce more. \n",
      "Because not much else is -- you don't need much to get it going again. \n",
      "And that, I think, we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they don't re-enter the business, much as we did with Russian scientists under the Nunn-Lugar program. \n",
      "BLITZER What about you, Senator Dodd, do you believe, in the end, they will find weapons of mass destruction? \n",
      "SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD (D), CONNECTICUT I have no evidence to the contrary. \n",
      "And certainly, they have used them in the past. \n",
      "There's no doubt about that at all, both in Iran and against the Kurdish population. \n",
      "So, whether or not they find them in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case -- possibly some got out of the country. \n",
      "It wouldn't surprise me to hear that. \n",
      "But I'm going to work on the assumption, based on the intelligence that has been gathered, that the weapons of mass destruction existed. \n",
      "BLITZER What if they don't? \n",
      "DODD Well, you know, they've used it in the past, and I think the point that Senator Lugar just made -- certainly having the intellectual capacity to do this was proven already by the fact they've used them in the past. \n",
      "So, I wouldn't dwell on that point specifically, because Saddam Hussein clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons. \n",
      "He clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity, and the world is a safer place today because he's not ruling Iraq. \n",
      "BLITZER Will the U.S. lose creditability, Mr. Chairman, if, if the U.S. finds no hard evidence, no so-called smoking gun? \n",
      "LUGAR No, we have full credibility in Iraq. \n",
      "We've prosecuted with the alliance a successful liberation of the Iraqi people, and we have clearly caused Saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction, or at least to suppress evidence of them. \n",
      "That is a victory of sorts.This is a facet that's important. \n",
      "It's important in the war against terrorism that we rout out whatever is there and, likewise, the people involved, because they might help supply al Qaeda or other terrorists along the trail. \n",
      "BLITZER Senator Dodd, how important is it for the U.S. to conclusively learn what happened to Saddam Hussein? \n",
      "DODD Well, it's important. \n",
      "But I don't think it's as important as finding Osama bin Laden, for the simple reason that I don't think Saddam Hussein today poses any threat, wherever he is. \n",
      "If he is alive, obviously, he doesn't pose the kind of threat that an Osama bin Laden does with his cellular network around the world to reactivate al Qaeda and international terrorism. \n",
      "So, it would certainly be good to know where he is. \n",
      "It would be, certainly, to know, to apprehend him, to bring him before a court of justice. \n",
      "But I don't think it's absolutely critical for the ultimate success of this mission that we apprehend him or find out what happened to him. \n",
      "BLITZER And you agree with that assessment, Mr. Chairman? \n",

      "North Korea said Tuesday that a 1992 agreement with South Korea not to deploy nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula was nullified, accusing the United States of derailing the deal. \n",
      "``The inter-Korean declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was thus reduced to a dead document due to the U.S. vicious hostile policy to stifle the DPRK with nukes,'' said the North's official news agency, KCNA. \n",
      "DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name. \n",
      "The announcement came as U.S. President George W. Bush and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun were about to meet Wednesday in Washington to discuss North Korea's nuclear programs. \n",

      "Washington says it wants to use dialogue to resolve the nuclear crisis, although U.S. officials have not ruled out a military option. \n",
      "North Korea ``keenly felt that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would only remain as a daydream unless the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK,'' KCNA said. \n",
      "It said the U.S. invasion of Iraq taught it that ``a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has ... a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons.'' \n",

Bush's administration said Friday. \n",
      "Separately, the United States has decided to divide the military and humanitarian relief mission in Iraq into three parts under American, British and Polish command, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n",

      "The United States and Britain agree on all but a few of the fine details of the resolution, the official said, though there is no timetable on when it would be introduced. \n",

      "``There has been a suggestion that the U.N. wanted to take over the whole Iraq and run it, which was also not the case.'' \n",
      "What the United Nations could contribute beyond humanitarian assistance was ``political facilitation,'' Annan said. \n",

      "The international stabilization force would be under the U.S. war commander, Gen. Tommy Franks. \n",

      "Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat. \n",
      "Instead, a menu of options may be considered, including installing infrared (IR) countermeasures on aircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures; improving airport and regional security; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts. \n",
      "Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement. \n",
      "However, this option has a relatively high cost, between $1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat. \n",
      "Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks. \n",
      "However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports. \n",
      "Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress (H.R. 580, S. 311) calls for the installation of missile defense systems in all turbojet aircraft used in scheduled air carrier service. \n",
      "While this legislation is still under consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60 million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology. \n",
      "It is anticipated that at the conclusion of this program, in January 2006, the Department of Homeland Security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of the suitability of such systems for use to protect commercial passenger aircraft.\n",

      "``The vote is desirable. \n",
      "It is not necessary,'' presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer said. \n",
      "The comments came as President George W. Bush and his advisers looked beyond the diplomatic showdown and made plans for a public relations buildup to potential war. \n",
      "One option under serious consideration was Bush giving Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein a final ultimatum, perhaps with a short-term deadline, in a major address next week, two senior White House officials said. \n",
      "The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed that a variety of options are on the table and they all depend on the outcome of a U.N. Security Council debate on the U.S.-backed war resolution. \n",
      "The United States still doesn't have the nine votes needed to win approval of the resolution, according to supporters and opponents, and many undecided council members are looking for a compromise. \n",
      "Even if he gets the required votes, Bush needs to avoid a veto by Russia, France or China who all favor continuing inspections at least into July. \n",
      "Once the vote is resolved one way or another, Bush will intensify his case for war, officials said, barring unforeseen events such as Saddam suddenly disarming or going into exile. \n",
      "In addition to a possible address, they have discussed a presidential news conference and a Cabinet meeting as ways for Bush to communicate his plans to the nation next week. \n",
      "As those discussions were taking place behind the scenes, Fleischer told reporters that Turkey would lose a proposed $15 billion aid package unless it admits troops into the country for the Iraq conflict. \n",
      "``The particular package that we've been talking to them about was predicated on assistance and cooperation in any plan for the use of force against Iraq,'' Fleischer said. \n",
      "Until Tuesday, the spokesman had suggested part of the package would be available to Turkey regardless of whether 62,000 American troops are allowed in the country. \n",
      "White House officials said they were turning up pressure on Turkey in hopes that the parliament would grant the U.S. request on a second vote. \n",
      "Even so, officials said future aid for Turkey would not be ruled out, just the massive package under consideration now. \n",

      "Both developments further complicated Bush's efforts to win passage of the resolution, adding significance to talk of what the administration would do if U.N. opposition cements against the U.S. position. \n",
      "``The president has made clear, that ... whether the United Nations votes or does not vote, that we will disarm Saddam Hussein with a coalition of the willing,'' Fleischer said. \n",

      "Several top diplomacy experts told a Kremlin-run forum that countries like China and India that said little about the conflict before its March 20 launch were already reaping the benefits. \n",
      "Some suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin will now be scrambling to contain the damage to his once-budding friendship with US President George W. Bush because he was poorly advised by his intelligence and defense aides. \n",
      "One analyst said China -- which like Russia and France wields a UN Security Council veto but never threatened to use it to prevent the war -- recently won its role as chief mediator between the United States and North Korea because other regional powers' confidence in Russia fell as a result of its Iraqi diplomacy. \n",
      "\"We are losing our positions in Asia because ... this failure of a strategic triangle that (Foreign Minister Igor) Ivanov invented with Germany and France,\" fumed Andrei Piontkovsky of Moscow's Center of Strategic Studies. \n",
      "Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang on their nuclear dispute have been set for April 23 in Bejing and are widely seen here as a blow to Moscow efforts to stamp authority on the region by organizing such a meeting. \n",

      "But not everyone here agreed that Moscow's diplomatic relations with Washington had suffered as badly. \n",
      "Most agreed that Russian diplomacy miscalculated and urged Putin to quickly reassess the quality of his advisers. \n",
      "\"Our analysis of foreign policy is lacking and often reverts to Cold War stereotypes,\" said former deputy foreign minister Anatoly Adamishin. \n",
      "\"We were so proud of forming an antiwar bloc with France and Germany -- but nations have not been forming such blocs for at least 12 years and someone in Moscow should have understood that it was impossible to avert this war.\" \n",
      "\"Our main goal now is to make sure that our relations with the United States do not suffer further -- and I think this is possible.\" \n",
      "US diplomats have hinted in recent weeks that Washington's anger with European resistance to the campaign was focused more on Paris -- and to a lesser extent Berlin -- than it was with Moscow. \n",
      "Putin last spoke to Bush on April 5 at the US president's own initiative. \n",
      "They are scheduled to meet next in the Russian leader's native city of Saint Petersburg in late May. \n",
      "\"We lost nothing and won nothing -- this was not our war,\" said liberal lawmaker Irina Khakamada of the Union of Rightist Forces. \n",
      "\"We showed the Americans that we would not give up on our position in Iraq cheaply and we did not. \n",
      "We should continue sticking to our principles.\" \n",
      "Khakamada argued that the United States would also need Russia's help \"to make the new Iraqi government seem legitimate.\" \n",
      "Most analysts linked Russia's opposition to a war in Iraq to fears that it will lose oil contracts that were sealed with the now-toppled regime of Saddam Hussein. \n",
      "The floodgates of Iraqi oil are also now likely to open to world markets and hurt Russia's budget revenues -- which are heavily reliant on revenues from its own energy exports. \n",

      "Although North Korea accused the United States of leading the region toward war in its state media, U.S. officials denied reports the talks had broken down. \n",
      "North Korea also hinted during the meetings that they have nuclear weapons and may conduct a test, a U.S. official said. \n",
      "Earlier, Secretary of State Colin Powell had told a gathering of experts from the Asia-Pacific region that the talks had concluded, leaving the impression there would not be a third day of discussions on Friday. \n",
      "Powell also expressed hope that South Korea and Japan will be able to participate ``when and if'' there is another round of talks. \n",
      "``North Korea should not leave the meetings having the slightest impression that they might force us to make a concession we would not otherwise make,'' he added. \n",
      "But U.S. State Department officials, asking not to be identified, said there may be more meetings on Friday. \n",
      "They said reports of a breakdown in the talks were a ``misrepresentation.'' \n",
      "One official said: ``We had the opportunity to say what we needed to say and to hear what the North Koreans wanted to tell us.'' \n",
      "A U.S. official said the North Koreans implied during the talks that they have nuclear weapons and that they may conduct a test. \n",
      "But the official said there are no indications a test is imminent. \n",
      "He acknowledged that preparations for an underground test could be concealed. \n",
      "According to the official, a North Korean nuclear detonation would deplete by half their estimated stockpile of two weapons. \n",

      "Discussions were scheduled to end Friday, when Kelly was to fly to Seoul the same day to meet with South Korean officials. \n",
      "The talks are the first high-level U.S.-North Korean contact since tensions over the North's nuclear program spiked six months ago over Washington's claim that the North said in October it was trying to develop nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 pledge. \n",

      "KCNA said the war in Iraq had shown the only way for a country to protect itself was to have a strong military deterrent. \n",
      "Officials from Seoul and Washington say the swift U.S.-led victory in Iraq prompted North Korea to agree to the nuclear talks. \n",
      "North Korea said the ``master key'' for successful talks was for the United States to drop its hostile policy toward Pyongyang. \n",
      "In a likely reference to North Korea's demand for a nonaggression treaty with Washington, KCNA said: ``The U.S. should settle the talks from a sincere stand and strive to settle the essential issue.'' \n",
      "Washington has refused to offer a formal treaty but says it would consider some sort of written assurance. \n",
      "The North also likely wants aid for its economy, which has been crippled by the loss of Soviet subsidies and years of drought and mismanagement. \n",

      "Why would an NBC reporter (who also reports on the U.N. for National Public Radio) take money from the U.N. lobby? \n",
      "Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA-USA and BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner. \n",
      "Not surprisingly, Brokaw is listed on the Fasulo book jacket as saying it is a \"must-read.\" \n",
      "Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that covers the U.N. \n",
      "A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. \n",
      "She tries to blame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it. \n",
      "She admits, however, that, \"The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping,\" and that \"After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies.\" \n",
      "Later, \"Annan accepted responsibility for failing to act more quickly,\" she writes. \n",
      "But responsibility for what? \n",
      "The truth is that, as director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide. \n",
      "Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned. \n",
      "The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign. \n",
      "All that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family. \n",
      "But the general needed U.N. authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives. \n",
      "He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous \"genocide fax\" from Annan's office. \n",
      "It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide! \n",
      "The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place. \n",
      "Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide. \n",
      "What a great guy he is isn't he. \n",
      "Or how about the ongoing prostitution that's going on in the Congo? \n",
      "Now the report comes out today on the Oil for Food scandal. \n",
      "Yeah...this guy is such a good SG. \n",
      "Eff him. \n",
      "The article ends with the following: In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted \"scant mention\" to the \"plain fact that it was Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office, who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994.\" \n",
      "It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings. \n",
      "But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan \"refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes.\" \n",
      "It is astonishing that a journalist for NBC New would close her eyes to Annan's role. \n",

      "Warplanes pounded forward Iraqi positions in the hills overlooking Chamchamal, 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of the key oil city of Kirkuk. \n",
      "Later Thursday, Kurdish troops in Chamchamal advanced their positions between government-controlled and rebel-controlled areas, taking over a Iraqi check point on their front with no fighting at this point, witnesses said. \n",
      "Early Thursday, Kurdish fighters closed off a highway and roads near the airstrip where troops were said to be arriving, outside the town of Bashur, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of the Kurd-controlled city of Irbil and 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of the Turkish border. \n",
      "From the highway, dusted from a recent snow, a flashing light from the airstrip's control tower was visible in the distance, and three helicopters could be seen landing, flying with nearly all their lights extinguished. \n",
      "Future airlifts into the area will include supplies and support personnel for the 173rd's fighters, defense officials said. \n",
      "The airfield's 6,700-foot (2,042-meter) runway is long enough to land C-17s and other U.S. military cargo planes. \n",
      "Lt. Col. Thomas Collins, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's Southern European Task Force, refused to say whether the paratroopers deployed directly from Italy into Iraq or had taken a different route. \n",

      "Pentagon officials had hoped to have the Army's 4th Infantry Division invade Iraq from the north, but Turkey balked at allowing up to 62,000 U.S. troops on its soil to prepare for that option. \n",
      "The use of the 173rd shows the military has shifted to a smaller, lighter force. \n",
      "Military officials say they would have liked to have secured key oil fields around the northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk _ and perhaps the cities themselves _ by now. \n",
      "Though no hostilities were expected during the deployment, the 173rd decided to parachute in rather then ferry troops in by plane so that a significant combat force could mass almost immediately to protect itself, officers said, according to a U.S. reporter traveling with the 173rd. \n",
      "``Kirkuk is key. \n",
      "The Iraqi's want it, the Kurds want it, the Turks want it and various other ethnic groups also want it,'' Maj. Mike Hastings said. \n",
      "``What this drop means is that we can secure it until we are relieved by other forces.'' \n",
      "Besides Mosul and Kirkuk, another key target in northern Iraq is Tikrit, Saddam's hometown and the tribal center for most of his inner circle. \n",
      "Most of the Adnan Division of the Republican Guard relocated from the Mosul area to the Tikrit area shortly before the war began. \n",
      "Another key mission for the 173rd could be to keep order in northern Iraq, which is controlled by two semi-autonomous Kurdish factions but also includes several splinter groups and a base for the al-Qaida-linked Ansar al-Islam. \n",

      "To a person, they acted with class, using their voices and not projectiles to express their displeasure. \n",
      "This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80's about five seconds after he had released a pass. \n",

      "Later this month Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri travels to Moscow to seek the Kremlin's help in modernizing her increasingly obsolete 300,000-member armed forces. \n",
      "She is also likely to open the way for Russian companies to vie for lucrative deals in the oil and gas sector, long dominated by American and British resource giants. \n",
      "Although opposite ends of the Earth, Indonesia and Russia have some basic things in common. \n",

      "Both are resource-rich, but face huge economic problems made worse by endemic corruption. \n",
      "And, currently, both have opposed the U.S.- led war on Iraq. \n",
      "Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa says Megawati's meeting with Russian President Putin slated for April 21 will touch on the Iraq crisis. \n",
      "But other diplomats say that issue will serve primarily to bring the two closer together on bottom-line issues such as trade and arms sales. \n",
      "Analysts worry that Indonesia's military is now so degraded it can no longer control the borders of the far-flung archipelago, allowing for easy infiltration by extremists. \n",
      "Last year's Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, illustrated the threat of terrorism in Indonesia. \n",
      "And, broad opposition to the U.S.-led attack on Iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant Islamists. \n",
      "``Nearly everybody in Indonesia sees this Iraq war as completely unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to U.S. policies,'' said Jusuf Wanadi of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta. \n",
      "Close ties between Moscow and Jakarta are not unprecedented. \n",
      "Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s under Megawati's father and founding President Sukarno, but these were severed after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seized power in 1965. \n",
      "The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country's main weapons supplier, and annual arms sales peaked at US$400 million in the 1980s. \n",
      "In 1991, however, the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor. \n",
      "In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence referendum. \n",
      "The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia. \n",
      "Since then some in the Bush administration _ particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta and a prime architect of the Iraq war _ have pushed for the ban to be repealed. \n",
      "So far, U.S. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officer training program. \n",
      "But that's far from enough for Indonesia's generals. \n",
      "``I think the Indonesian military has finally decided that restrictions and conditionalities from Washington are just not worth it,'' said Juwono Sudarsono, a former defense minister. \n",

      "Currently, Indonesia uses short-range Rapier missiles purchased 30 years ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas fields in Sumatra, Borneo and Papua from air attack. \n",
      "``Replenishing them has been a big problem,'' Sudarsono said. \n",
      "Air defense commanders want to augment the Rapiers with Russia's impressive long-range S-300 missiles, or shorter-range systems such as the SA-15 Gauntlet or shoulder-fired Igla. \n",
      "The Air Force is reportedly considering purchasing several squadrons of Sukhoi Su-27 interceptors, considered the world's premier dogfighters. \n",
      "Previously, Indonesian Air Force commanders preferred Western jets that were compatible with the U.S.-made F-16 fighter-bombers already in the Indonesian inventory. \n",
      "But neighboring Malaysia's success in integrating Russian MiG-29s and American F/A-18 Hornets persuaded them otherwise, Sudarsono said. \n",
      "If Megawati does stiff-arm the United States on the weapons issue, it is unlikely relations with Washington will be permanently damaged. \n",
      "Whatever happens, Indonesia, a mainly Muslim but politically secular state, is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and religious militancy. \n",
      "What could be more worrying for Washington is Russia's economic ambitions. \n",

Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday their friendship was as strong as ever, laying aside a dispute over the Iraq war, but barely concealing a simmering row over Iran's nuclear program. \n",
      "After talks in Saint Petersburg's grand Konstantinovsky Palace, they also warned North Korea to abandon its nuclear aspirations and signed documents implementing the Moscow Treaty, which mandates sharp cuts in Cold War nuclear weapons stocks. \n",
      "Swapping smiles, handshakes and hugs at a joint press appearance after talks linked to Saint Petersburg's 300th anniversary celebrations, Bush and Putin set out to recreate the buddy atmosphere of their previous encounters. \n",
      "\"Our relations are stronger than the events that tested it,\" said Putin, stressing that despite diverging over Iraq, Russia and the United States had many common interests. \n",
      "\"It is precisely these things that enable me to call President Bush my friend, not only personally -- because I do like him a lot -- but as my counterpart and the president of a friendly nation,\" he said, earning a grin from Bush. \n",
      "But both men observed an uneasy truce over US concerns about Russian aid to the nuclear program of Iran, whom Bush has labeled part of an \"axis of evil\" that also included Iraq and North Korea. \n",
      "\"We are concerned about Iran's advanced nuclear program and urge Iran to comply in full with its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\" Bush said. \n",
      "A senior US diplomat said Bushehr remains one of the biggest irritants in Russia-US relations. \n",
      "\"We think that it would be wise for Russia to go slow on the Bushehr project until the wider Iranian nuclear program is more clearly understood,\" the US diplomat said after the informal summit talks. \n",
      "\"Our belief is that any proliferation, coming from any source, should be stopped.\" \n",
      "The United States believes that what Iran says is a peaceful civilian nuclear program is a pretext for weapons manufacture. \n",
      "Washington has been pressuring Russia to stop building a nuclear power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran, which it has so far declined to do. \n",
      "\"I appreciate Vladimir Putin's understanding of the issue and his willingness to work with me and others to solve this potential problem,\" said Bush. \n",
      "Putin insisted that the two sides were \"closer than they seem\" on the issue. \n",
      "\"We do not need to be convinced of the fact that there should no proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\" he said. \n",
      "But in a sharp remark that jolted the bonhomie, Putin warned Russia was not yet ready to sever nuclear ties with Iran. \n",
      "\"We are against the pretext of using the nuclear weapons program in Iran as a lever in unfair business competition against us,\" he said. \n",
      "Bush signalled that Russia would not pay a similar price as France and Germany for opposing the US-led war in Iraq, inviting his \"good friend\" Putin to his weekend retreat outside Camp David in Washington in September. \n",
      "Putin last visited Bush at his Texas ranch in November 2001. \n",
      "There was no word on the fate of billions of dollars of Russian oil contracts in Iraq, whose oil industry is now under the administration of the United States and Britain in line with latest UN resolutions, which Russia was persuaded to back. \n",
      "But Putin noted that \"Russian companies have a wealth of experience operating in Iraq and we intend to continue our cooperation in this area, with Iraq and in Iraq.\" \n",
      "\"What the president (Putin) meant was that at times, and we have come across this, there were unreasonable complaints about Russian companies' cooperation with Iran,\" said Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, pointing the finger clearly at the United States after the summit. \n",
      "Bush and Putin also signed formal documents putting into effect a strategic arms reduction treaty that slashes the two sides' nuclear weapons to a range of 1,700 to 2,200 nuclear warheads by the year 2012. \n",

      "The comments indicate that Russia's nuanced position over the war in Iraq was becoming ever more scrambled, with Putin pushing to protect his budding friendship with US President George W. Bush in the face of strident opposition from the Russian media and other top Kremlin officials. \n",
      "Analysts have long argued that Putin is far keener to preserve friendly relations with the United States than the pro-European, anti-war camps embedded in much of the Russian media and the foreign and defense ministries. \n",
      "Russia's foreign minister expressed outrage at suggestions from a top Washington official last week that Moscow should forgive the eight billion dollars in Soviet-era debt that Baghdad owes it, as a gesture of good will. \n",
      "Kommersant business daily joined in, declaring in a furious front-page headline: \"The United States is demanding that Russia, France and Germany pay for the Iraqi war.\" \n",
      "And the popular Gazeta.ru news website stormed: \"We should have expected this!\n",
      ".\n",
      ". \n",
      "This is only the start of a massive US campaign (to decide Iraq's future finances).\" \n",
      "Yet Putin has been far more reserved. \n",
      "He and his loyal finance minister suggested Friday that Moscow might be prepared to waiver some of the Iraqi debts in return for better Russia-US relations. \n",
      "\"On the whole the proposal is understandable and legitimate,\" Putin said. \n",
      "\"Russia has no objections to such a proposal.\" \n",
      "Putin concluded his two days of talks in Saint Petersburg with Jacques Chirac of France and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday still urging for a central role for the United Nations in a post-war revival of Iraq. \n",
      "The call reflected the insistent demand made by the three leaders before the US-British invasion of Iraq that UN approval was essential for any mission to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. \n",
      "But the Saint Petersburg summit ended without any formal declaration on Iraq. \n",
      "And diplomats noted that Putin appeared uncomfortable at being so closely associated with the anti-Washington stance of Schroeder and Chirac amid his developing friendship with Bush. \n",
      "Putin had even secretly invited British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Bush's staunchest backer in the war on Iraq, to attend the pow-wow in Saint Petersburg's Grand Hotel Europe, although diplomats said Blair turned the offer down. \n",
      "It remains to be seen how successful Putin's overtures to Washington will be in the face of the fervent internal hostility to the US war stance. \n",
      "A senior lawmaker seen as close to the Kremlin ridiculed the United States Sunday for failing to find any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. \n",
      "\"We do not think that America won,\" said Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the lower house of parliament's foreign affairs committee, told Rossia television. \n",
      "\"Where are those chemical weapons?\" \n",
      "he demanded. \n",
      "And Putin's media aide, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told Kommersant Russia would not forgive the Iraqi debt. \"\n",
      "(Washington) should not be so generous at other people's expense,\" he said.\n"
